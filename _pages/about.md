In 2010, my cousin and I stood on the land we had inherited, a vast stretch of untouched nature whispering with the winds of our ancestors. Life had become too fast, too digital, and we longed for something real—something that connected us to the raw simplicity of existence. We envisioned a place where one could step away from the noise of modernity and return to the rhythms of nature, to a time when people gathered their own food, lived in harmony with the earth, and found joy in the quiet labor of their hands. It was more than a dream; it was a calling. And so, with determination in our hearts, we set out to transform this land into an ecotourism retreat—a sanctuary for those seeking the solace of a simpler past.

After five years of tireless effort, we finally saw our vision come to life. In 2015, we named our retreat "Asiakade", a Persian word that speaks of the ancient art of milling wheat into flour—a process that has sustained humanity for centuries. The name carried the essence of what we wished to offer: a return to the fundamental, to the grounding experience of working with the earth and reaping its gifts. Today, "Asiakade" stands as a living testament to our belief that true fulfillment lies not in the speed of progress, but in the depth of connection—to nature, to tradition, and to the simple joys of being. Every guest who visits leaves a part of their modern burdens behind and walks away with something far more valuable—peace, presence, and a rekindled bond with the world as it once was.
